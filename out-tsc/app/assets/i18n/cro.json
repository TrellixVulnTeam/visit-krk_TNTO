        "description": "Welcome to the historic center of Omišalj, a picturesque and layered urban structure with elements of medieval architecture, Renaissance, Baroque, historical styles of the 19th and the early 20th century. Omišalj was founded on the basis of an earlier village whose roots go back to prehistory. The original fort-type habitat defended by strong dry-walled ramparts was the seat of the Liburnian tribal community of Fertinata. It stagnated during the Roman Empire, when the nearby coastal country and port city of Fulfinum was developing, and flourished again during the early and developed Middle Ages.<br><br>Omišalj was the first among the already existing villages on the island, which in the early Middle Ages were populated en masse by immigrant Croats, achieving a harmonious coexistence with the Romanized indigenous community. During the Middle Ages, it was a stronghold of the princes of Krk, later Frankapans, who built two strong fortifications in front of it and next to it. The Venetians who ruled Omišalj in 1480 justifiably called it the 'key to the island of Krk' due to its strategic importance. Even today, this is clear to anyone who enters the historic center of city and finds himself on one of its lookouts from which one could easily see a good part of the Kvarner Bay. As nowhere else on the island of Krk, in Omišalj, parts of medieval and renaissance architecture intertwine with unusual out-of-style architectural structures. We are great as much as we hold on to the values we inherit, and as much as we preserve them for future generations. If we connect historical, artistic, archeological and historiographical data with the specifics of Omišalj tradition, speech, folk songs and customs, we will discover much about the turbulent history of this part of the island which has remained the key to the island of Krk."

The inscription mentions the priest Matija Franović and the year 1535. Originally, the inscription was not located in this rather undistinguished place. The stone block was the lintel of the portal of the rectory and the owner marked the completion of the building with an inscription and a cross, as was common practice in the Renaissance. This also had an apotropaic function, that is, to defend the house from evil. Nowhere in the world are there so many preserved Glagolitic stone inscriptions as on the island of Krk. These inscriptions attest to the fact that literacy was widespread among the ordinary inhabitants of the island. The most important role in this was played by the priests of the chapters of the small towns of Omišalj, Dobrinj, Vrbnik and Baška, which at the time were referred to as kašteli (castles).",

It is a single-nave longitudinal basilica with a Latin-cross plan.</b><br><br>The basilica has been preserved up to the roof level. It is the only preserved sacral building of this type not only on the island of Krk, but on the entire Croatian Littoral.<br><br>The construction of this church on the remains of the Roman town of Fulfinum marked the beginning of a new Christian town. However, its secrets are yet to be discovered by experts. Local tradition associates this church with the Glagolitic Benedictine abbey of St Nicholas, which was abandoned in the 15th century and relocated closer to Omišalj.<br><br>In its original construction phase, this impressive single-nave church had an entrance area in the front (called the narthex or vestibule), a porch on its south side, and two smaller side rooms which could be defined as early examples of a sacristy and which were connected to the wall of the presbytery. The presbytery itself has a simple layout: its rear is flat and features a freestanding bench for the clergy. In front of the bench there is part of the presbytery enclosed with an altar balustrade with a cross-shaped altar tomb at its centre. The entrance area contains a sarcophagus dug into solid rock and covered with mortar. A privileged tomb with two deceased was later placed alongside the sarcophagus. It has been dated to the period between the 7th and 8th century.<br><br>The atrium at the south porch, which also features several privileged tombs, was probably added at the same time. Over the centuries that followed, this community developed into a well-organised religious community that eventually took on the teachings of St. Benedictine, as suggested by later sources that mention the Abbey of St. Nicholas at the foot of Omišalj. Inside this monastery complex, on the eastern side of the church which also underwent changes in its interior, there are smaller spaces of a memorial and commercial character.",

Thus in the developed phase dating to the end of the 1st century AD in its central part, but drawn along the northwestern edge of the forum space which occupied 1300 m2, stood the main forum temple, dedicated to either the Capitoline Triad or the three main deities of Roman religion Jupiter, Juno and Minerva, or possibly Roman emperors.<br><br>The simple-looking temple, with only four pillars in the façade and a simple inner whole raised to a height of about one meter above the walking surface of the forum mirror, was surrounded by a dedicated space formed by the perimeter walls of the forum west and north and the porch wall on the east. Along the west, longer side of the forum ran a series of rooms – taverns – which certainly could not be entered directly from the forum, but from the opposite side facing the sea. In the eastern part of the forum is a very long building with only three small rooms in its northern part, preceded by a large inner open courtyard bordered by two porches. The mentioned space could be entered through a door open in the wall that bounded the space of the forum mirror on that side. Finally, the entrance to the forum space was marked by a portico above which stood an inscription of a devotional character.<br><br>The Fulfinum City Forum will undergo major alterations in the 3rd century, with an intimate square on the northeast side of the main temple, in the middle of which was found a masonry base in which stood a monument – a statue or inscription – which unfortunately completely lost its trace. In the period before the final departure of the forum, and even the city itself, certain spaces were “privatized”. At the forum, the symbol of the public space of the Roman city, light, wooden constructions appear, which prove the loss of the original function of the square.",

These latter were religious associations engaged in charity work but were also the key drivers of construction activity when it came to sacral buildings in the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern Era. Two master builders were in charge of construction: Pjero of Omišalj and Andrij from the village of Kotor near Crikvenica. At that time, the priest of Omišalj was Matija Vlčijić, and the castellan was Nikola Antončić. Detailed information can be obtained from the Glagolitic inscription which the proud builders made above the bell tower portal. In the bifora (mullioned window) of the bell tower, the master builders integrated parts of the pre-Romanesque church fittings.<br><br>In these troubled times, when both the danger of Ottoman attacks and Austro-Venetian conflict was a threat, this bell tower, just like elsewhere along the eastern Adriatic coast, did not have only a sacral purpose but also served as an observation point over the surrounding waters.

Next to the chapel, a dome and sacristy were added in the 16th and 17th centuries. The church is a treasury of valuable sacral items. A large wood-carved, polychrome altarpiece on the main altar, the work of an unknown artist from 1565, stands out. It features an incorporated early Renaissance wood-carved polyptych. In the apse of the southern nave, there is a polyptych of St. John the Baptist, dating to the period around 1410. The painted parts of the polyptych have been attributed to the Venetian painter Jacobello del Fiore, while the relief of St. John is a Gothic piece that was created later. The walls and the ceiling of the church were painted by a local painter and decorator Ivan Volarić, and the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament by Stanislava Radimiri.<br><br>In the lunette above the main door of the church, early medieval stone reliefs, parts of the pluteus and pulpit of a pre-Romanesque altar screen, were subsequently integrated. These probably belonged to a church which stood on this site before the preserved Romanesque basilica. Adjacent to the parish church, there is the former Gothic Chapel of St. John, while next to it there is a massive Renaissance bell tower. This church complex is a treasury of early medieval stone sculptures from an earlier sacral building that was located in this place. The Glagolitic inscriptions carved in stone record the years of its construction and additional works on the church (1405, in the month of June , this window was done for Mr Martin Glušac).<br><br> The church was built at the turn of the 12th century as a three-aisled Romanesque basilica whose builders were directly influenced by the large Romanesque buildings in the town of Krk. The three naves are separated by an arcature that lies on massive columns with a square cross-section. The central nave ends in a main apse with a rectangular layout, and the side naves in small semi-circular apses (the southern apse is hidden by a recent annex). In the lunette of the main portal on the western façade, on the exterior and interior wall, and on the pillars and pulpits, fragments of church fittings (slabs/plutei, beams, pilasters and parts of the tegurium and pulpit from an earlier church) have been incorporated. They can be easily recognised by their characteristic Christian motifs: a belief in constant renewal, resurrection and eternal life. These motifs include skilfully modelled knotted endless braiding, circles, semi-rosettes, whirled rosettes, cypresses, vines, birds and other vegetable and zoomorphic ornamentation. Reliefs were subsequently added to the Romanesque parish church, both during its construction and afterwards.<br><br>Pre-Romanesque master builders carved the church fittings on the spot, mostly using Istrian limestone, which was transported here in blocks by ship, and also partly marble from Greek quarries, which was used as spolia from existing local buildings. The rose window on the façade of the church is a naïve work by the local master builder Sinoga. Its Glagolitic inscription dates it to the year 1405. Some unofficial inscriptions/graffiti in Glagolitic letters were inscribed on the Romanesque lateral portal in later periods (15th-17th century). In the 16th century, the church was systematically enlarged, which is documented by a Glagolitic inscription from the year 1525 on one of the chapels along the northern nave. The cross vaults of the side chapels attest to the fact that local master builders still built in the late Gothic style. Adaptations intensified under the imperative of changes to the liturgy dictated by the Council of Trent, and culminated with the construction of the dome above the presbytery in the 17th century, and the inclusion of the previously separate church of St. John the Baptist in the 18th century.<br><br>In the centre of the late Renaissance altar retable, part of its early Renaissance predecessor has been preserved. This wood-carved and painted sculpture is among the greatest achievements of Venetian production of the time. The same is true for the processional crosses, reliquaries and censers. A visitation in the second half of the 16th century mentions that the church had as many as 18 altars. In the right apse, there is a wood-carved and painted altar retable of St. John the Evangelist, which has been attributed to Jacobello del Fiore (early 15th century). The frescoes in the dome and on the ceiling of the main nave were painted in 1929 by the local artist Ivan Volarić.<br><br> Today's sacristy, the former Chapel of St. John the Baptist, is located next to the side entrance to the southern nave of the parish church. Its Gothic façade was constructed in 1442, which is attested to by the Glagolitic inscription located between the original openings, the now walled-up portal and a narrow window with slanted frame edges (In the name of God, amen. In the year of our Lord 1442 this façade was constructed, and at that time the officials were the priest Petar and Dv…). Stylistically, they can be recognised by their characteristic pointed arch. It is assumed that beneath the chapel there are the remnants of the former baptistery of the church that was originally located in this place.",

The inscription from the year 94 makes mention of the Emperor Domitian as the builder of the aqueduct. His name and title, as elsewhere in the Roman Empire, were officially erased by a decision of the Senate (damnatio memoriae) and removed from the surface of the stone inscription; what remains is the name of Lucius Sextis Dexter, a veteran of the Third Praetorian Cohort who, probably as an inhabitant of Fulfinum, made a donation towards some of the work on the aqueduct. Parts of the early medieval stone fittings from the early 9th-century church, which preceded the present Collegiate Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, are also worth mentioning. A tombstone slab with a Glagolitic inscription and a relief depicting the bishop's mitre and pastoral staff, dating back to 1477, is particularly interesting.
