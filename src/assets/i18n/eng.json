    "description": "Welcome to the historic center of Omišalj, a picturesque and layered urban structure with elements of medieval architecture, Renaissance, Baroque, historical styles of the 19th and the early 20th century. Omišalj was founded on the basis of an earlier village whose roots go back to prehistory. The original fort-type habitat defended by strong dry-walled ramparts was the seat of the Liburnian tribal community of Fertinata. It stagnated during the Roman Empire, when the nearby coastal country and port city of Fulfinum was developing, and flourished again during the early and developed Middle Ages.<br><br>Omišalj was the first among the already existing villages on the island, which in the early Middle Ages were populated en masse by immigrant Croats, achieving a harmonious coexistence with the Romanized indigenous community. During the Middle Ages, it was a stronghold of the princes of Krk, later Frankapans, who built two strong fortifications in front of it and next to it. The Venetians who ruled Omišalj in 1480 justifiably called it the 'key to the island of Krk' due to its strategic importance. Even today, this is clear to anyone who enters the historic center of city and finds himself on one of its lookouts from which one could easily see a good part of the Kvarner Bay. As nowhere else on the island of Krk, in Omišalj, parts of medieval and renaissance architecture intertwine with unusual out-of-style architectural structures. We are great as much as we hold on to the values we inherit, and as much as we preserve them for future generations. If we connect historical, artistic, archeological and historiographical data with the specifics of Omišalj tradition, speech, folk songs and customs, we will discover much about the turbulent history of this part of the island which has remained the key to the island of Krk."

      "description": "<b>The church of All Saints in Sužan dates back to 1514 when it was built under the patronage of the brotherhood of All Saints from Sužan.</b><br><br>    Today’s parish church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, topographically situated at the highest part of the village, is a single-nave hall church,\n    laid in the direction north-south, with a large rectangular apse protruding on the northern side. On the east side of the apse there is the sacristy, and along,\n    the west wall of the apse there is the chapel of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, built in 1505. The façade on the southern side is shaped in the Classicistic,\n    style with three rectangular openings, a portal and a pair of laterally placed windows and two semi-circular niches, symmetrically placed into the outer face of,\n    the façade wall. There are two chapels situated along the eastern wall of the church hall. The one closer to the entrance is dedicated to Our Lady of Rosary and,\n    dates from the 15th century, while the second one, today walled-in, is the chapel of the Presentation of Mary, the so-called Šegina chapel from 1546. The luxurious,\n    gilded Renaissance wooden altar is situated on the main church altar. The central place is taken by the altar painting representing the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.,\n    There are no material or written sources witnessing the beginning of the establishment of the church and the parish church itself in Vrbnik. The first document,\n    about the village cathedral and the parish priest dates from 1325 from the Statute of the Brotherhood of St John the Baptist in Vrbnik. The Statute mentioned the,\n    priest Damjan and the Vrbnik parish church of St Mary. The church got its today’s appearance through late-Medieval and early Modern Era reconstructions, but there,\n    is still no physical evidence about the original church in Vrbnik.,\n    The description of the apostolic visitor Agostino Valier in 1579 is so far the most important source for the church’s appearance before the reconstructions at the,\n    end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th century, with Valier describing it as a smaller three-nave church with many altars, too small for the population.,\n    A major reconstruction followed soon after Valier’s description, which deleted all the existing elements and the church was oriented north-south. This reconstruction,\n    demolished the church of St John the Evangelist, mentioned in the canonical visitation from 1565 as a separate edifice, detached from the parish church and used as a baptistery.,\n    Recent archaeological research conducted in the smaller garden discovered the remains of an older edifice along the church façade with a semicircular wall, perhaps an,\n    apse of an older sacral edifice which preceded the today’s church.,\n    The bell tower, the indispensable motif of the Vrbnik landscape, is located to the west of the church. It was built in 1527, which is witnessed by the Glagolitic,\n    inscription at its entrance. It had four bells – three large ones and one smaller one.",

Kr.</b><br><br>In the area of ​​Fulfinum (today’s toponym Okladi) the remains of various buildings from the Roman era are still well recognizable. Particularly impressive are the recently explored parts of the forum, the heart of the ancient city with its forum temple, basilica and taverns, and parts of the monumental architectural sculpture of public, forum buildings. Despite systematic research in recent years, the city of Municipium Flavium Fulfinum is for the most part still unexplored and unexcavated. His name is precisely known thanks to the finding of an inscription from the time of the Roman emperor Domitian, which mentions some works on the city waterworks. The inscription is kept in the Lapidary collection in Omišalj.<br><br>Masonry structures and even the layout of communications are well visible in the configuration of the terrain. As the area has been cultivated for the past centuries, the remains of the plastered walls of ancient buildings are partly covered with dry stone mounds – boulders. The piers and representative buildings with floor mosaics are partly covered with mud in the shallows of Sepen Bay. The city was regulated by Roman grammarians as a completely new creation in a field where no settlement had existed before. The inhabited Roman veterans were given land that belonged to the natives of Omišalj – Fertinati. Such a lowland and coastal city had no chance of survival despite attempts to fortify it in late antiquity. It slowly died out and finally completely died out like Salona and many other cities of Roman civilization shaken by the migration of peoples.<br><br>Southwest of the forum at the Mirina site there is a late antique necropolis with a series of smaller and several large, privileged tombs and a large to the roof preserved tomb basilica of the presumed titular St. Nicholas. Due to its excellent preservation, the church can serve as an exemplary example of early Christian sacral buildings. The basic shape of the Latin cross is given to the church by its transverse nave – the transept. An exhibition of movable archeological material has been set up in its narthex, which has been restored and partly reconstructed. There is also an in situ preserved early Christian sarcophagus.<br><br>The atrium that extends along the south wall of the church towards the sea is the result of the subsequent adaptation of the building to the religious community, which eventually abandoned it, when it could no longer maintain it due to its dimensions. The Benedictines sought to continue the continuity by adapting a suburban residential complex with baths, located west of the basilica.
