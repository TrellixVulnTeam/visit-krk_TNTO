    "title": "History of Island of Krk",
    "description": "The dynamic history of the island of Krk was determined by its favourable geographical position (the crossroads of merchant routes),\n mild climate, sufficient amount of arable land and a considerable number of hills for fortifying the villages. Its earliest traces date back,\n into prehistory. Although the remains of this ancient past have not yet been adequately investigated, they were found on strategically positioned,\n  hills (around the church of St Peter in Gabonjin) and in the caves of the island of Krk. The period of Roman domination left many traces on the island,\nof Krk, preserved below Omišalj at the archaeological site Fulfinum, in the cove Soline around the Medieval church of St Peter and within the today’s,\ncities Baška and Krk. The best preserved traces of Roman culture are located in the catering facilities Volsonis and Mate in the city of Krk. The caffé,\n Volsonis is incorporated into the Roman walls of the city and the café Mate has an excellently preserved Roman mosaic showing the mythical creature Triton.,\n  The earliest traces of Christianity originate from the fifth century, when the religion was accepted by the Empire. That is when the important sacral,\n  buildings were built along the very centres of power of the late Antiquity. The earliest and best-preserved edifices are the old Christian basilica in,\n  Mirine built next to the Roman city Fulfinum, the remains of the old Christian church below the church of St Marco in Baška and the remains of a very,\n  early sacral edifice found in the foundations of the Krk cathedral.,\n  The today’s island of Krk is divided into seven municipalities with larger towns as administrative centres: Omišalj, Malinska, Dobrinj, Vrbnik, Krk,,\n  Punat and Baška. The similar division of the island, except for Punat and Malinska which are younger, has been preserved since the Middle Ages when the,\n  island castles were managed by the princely family Frankopan under the watchful eye of Venice. The family Frankopan took care of preserving the peace on,\n  the island, proper arrangement of legal relations, cherishing the tradition through the Croatian language and the Glagolitic script, as well as maintaining,\n  the sacral objects necessary for liturgical purposes. The old Frankopan castle-fortress called Gradec has been preserved near the village Vrbnik, while the,\n  city of Krk contains a grand Frankopan castle, a representative defensive structure and a constituent part of the city walls.,\n  The uncertainty of the Middle Ages stimulated the construction of villages at high places so their geographical position would provide the possibility of,\n  control over the arable land and the protection from possible assaults. The city walls were preserved only in Krk, while in other villages, like Dobrinj,,\n  traces of walls can only be seen within the thick walls of the houses located in the outer ring of the town. Island villages have still preserved some,\n  recognizable elements of traditional masonry in small stone houses radially set on narrow streets around the main city square, with the bell towers of local,\n  churches proudly standing out as trademarks of any village (the church of St Stephen – Dobrinj, the church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary – Vrbnik,\n and the church of the Assumption of Mary – Omišalj).,\n  This project summarizes in one place the rich centuries-old cultural heritage of the island of Krk from its Roman era to the modern age. It covers a series,\n  of archaeological sites, fortresses, old Christian, Medieval and modern church buildings and monasteries and other representative cultural goods of the Krk, island towns."

      "description": "The remains of an interesting sacral edifice, the church of St Mary of the Spring is located in the camp Ježevac, on an elevated plateau,\n  surrounded by a forest. The church was first mentioned in 1486, but only the fact that it existed, not when it was built. The church is a simple,,\n  single-nave structure with semicircular apse protruding on the east side, the walls of which are made of dressed stones laid in regular layers.,\n  This way of masonry, the dimension and form of the edifice are characteristic for Romanesque churches, made from the 12th until the 13th century.,\n  Still, the findings of decorative stone reliefs indicate its slightly earlier emergence, in the 11th century. In the later stage of construction,,\n  a smaller rectangular addition was added on the northern side of the church. The thickness of the walls indicates that this was a high structure,,\n  probably a bell tower. The church is on a dominant position, offering a view of the channel, so the bell tower obviously served to alarm the,\n  population of the nearby city of Krk in case of incoming danger from the sea.,\n  A significant finding was discovered east of the church, near the apse. Here, in a live rock rising about fifty centimetres above the ground level,,\n  a deep pit was discovered, which may be interpreted as a natural well. There are visible traces of dressing on the rock, which made this inaccessible,\n  natural creation into a usable source of water through human activity. This well-spring is obviously the reason why the church was located at this,\n  site and it is the holder of the name Sancta Maria delle Aque, or St Mary of the Spring.,\n  The local tradition, noted around 1500, mentions a legend related to the church about the arrival of St Francis to the island of Krk, where he hid,\n  with his brothers from the incoming storm in the harbour along the church of the Mother of God. According to the legend, this is where they found a,\n  hermit who was taught about the rules of their order. The hermit accepted those rules and they became the basis of the establishment of the Franciscan,\n  order in the city of Krk.",

      "description": "In a small alley leading from the main city square, Vela Placa, towards the south, there is the café Mate where archaeological research found a,\n  mosaic floor with a rich figurative illustration. According to its stylistic characteristics it was dated into the 1st century and represents the work,\n  of several masters. The centre of the mosaic is dominated by the mythological being Triton, with a human body and a fish tail. Triton is the sea deity,,\n  the son of Poseidon and the Nereid Amphitrite. It is surrounded by images of sea fauna, dolphins and fish with stylized dragon-like features. It is,\n  assumed that Triton is just one of four figures of this mosaic floor. There is the image of the wine container – cantharus in the mosaic decoration.,\n  The container is held by another mythological being with a human torso, horse legs and a fish tail, probably an Ichthyocentaurus. Owing to the damage of,\n  the mosaic, only his mane and trident in the left hand can be recognized. The merry atmosphere and the content of the illustration indicate that this is a,\n  scene of a sea feast.,\n  The third mythological being is also preserved only in traces. This is probably Hermes’ son Pan. This is indicated by the illustration of the syrinx with,\n  which he contributed to the atmosphere of the feast.,\n  By establishing the existence of the three figures, Triton, Ichthyocentaurus and Pan, completely equal in their presentation, standing approximately at,\n  the same distance from each other, we get the impression that the fourth figure is missing, the one that would complete the image of the entire sea feast.,\n  This mosaic was probably the floor of the thermae in a luxurious private building.",

According to the architectural remains, the area was inhabited in the late Antiquity,,\n  and the settlement was conditioned by two factors – firstly, by well protected sea coves, Vela Luka and Mala Luka, and by the agricultural fields stretching,\n  in the lowland area of Bosar.,\n  The castrum Korintija emerged on the peninsula Sokol, rising up to 129 meters. The castrum is dated into the time of late Antiquity as one of a series of,\n  structures of early Byzantine military architecture, emerged along the east Adriatic coast during the spread of castrization. This and similar castrums,\n  served as watchtowers and military bases, while their function resulted from the wish to make the waterways safe, but also to serve as refuge for the,\n  nearby villages. Within the fortress walls, on the north-east slightly elevated plateau, there are still the remains of the church dating from the 6th century.,\n  In the fertile coastal lowland Bosar there are still visible remains of three other churches.

The church got its today’s appearance through late-Medieval and early Modern Era reconstructions, but there,\n  is still no physical evidence about the original church in Vrbnik.,\n  The description of the apostolic visitor Agostino Valier in 1579 is so far the most important source for the church’s appearance before the reconstructions at the,\n  end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th century, with Valier describing it as a smaller three-nave church with many altars, too small for the population.,\n  A major reconstruction followed soon after Valier’s description, which deleted all the existing elements and the church was oriented north-south. This reconstruction,\n  demolished the church of St John the Evangelist, mentioned in the canonical visitation from 1565 as a separate edifice, detached from the parish church and used as a baptistery.,\n  Recent archaeological research conducted in the smaller garden discovered the remains of an older edifice along the church façade with a semicircular wall, perhaps an,\n  apse of an older sacral edifice which preceded the today’s church.,\n  The bell tower, the indispensable motif of the Vrbnik landscape, is located to the west of the church. It was built in 1527, which is witnessed by the Glagolitic,\n  inscription at its entrance. It had four bells – three large ones and one smaller one.",

Until today the Romanesque edifice has remained preserved with,\n  its extremely rich inventory, and small additional constructions from the later period of Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque stylistic features.,\n  The archaeological findings prove the existence of the original antique layer, the thermae from the 1st century, at the site of today’s cathedral.,\n  Considerable reconstruction was undertaken in the Romanesque period on the entire cathedral complex. The inscription on the cathedral,\n  mentions the reconstruction of the colonnade (columnarum opus) in the 12th century, conducted by the unknown Krk bishop (mentioned by the initial D),,\n  but it most probably happened during the time of the bishop Dabar (Dobro – Bonus) around 1179. A part of the cathedral complex today,\n  constitutes the church of St Quirin, a beautiful example of the Romanesque sacral architecture. The first information about it dates back,\n  from 1335 when the people of Krk gave the rent from the island Plavnik “for the repair of the church of St Quirin in Krk”. It is assumed that,\n  it was built in the 12th century. The church is particular for its two floors and its geographic orientation as its apse is completely,\n  untypically directed towards the south, probably owing to the constricted space on which it was built. The upper church is dedicated,\n  to St Quirin, the patron saint of the city of Krk, and the lower church of St Margaret was dedicated to the martyr from Antiochia.,\n  These Romanesque churches were built from white local stone. The appearance of the church is complemented by the three-apse ending with,\n  prominent ornament of blind Romanesque arcades at the top and the border made of polished red local stone (mandorlat) in the middle.,\n  It is assumed that the upper church (St Quirin) was actually the matroneum of the cathedral from where the women used to participate in,\n  the mass held in the cathedral. There is a possibility that St Quirin had the function of a palatine chapel of the Krk bishop or a western,\n  edifice (gallery, westwerk) from where the Krk princes followed the mass.,\n  The bell tower of the Krk cathedral is situated at the northern façade of St Quirin. The place of its construction was determined by the Venetian,\n  provveditore Vinciguerra in 1489, while the construction was finished in 1515. The bell tower was hit by lightning in 1714, when the main keystone,\n  pyramid cracked and crashed.,\n  In the 1760s, a thorough restoration was undertaken according to the sketches by the Venetian architect Pietro Checchi. A wooden angel coated in copper,\n  plates, made in Venice, was placed on the bell tower. Since 1973, there is a plastic angel at the top of the bell tower made according to the mould of the decrepit old angel.",

According to its construction, this single-nave church with the protruded apse on the east can be dated back to the 6th century, while the future archaeological research will bring more insight about the site. The church is located in a beautiful landscape, in a lonely quiet place, to the south of Vrbnik. It can be accessed from the sea and from the land. Along with the church, in the natural cove sheltering it from the stormy bora, there is a little port with the quay for berthing. If you set out to this place on foot, you will pass through a charming but rough landscape. Prepare yourself for real training, both of nerves and of the muscles, as the site is far away, the ground is challenging, and summer days can be really hot. However, at the same time, the final destination is extremely intimate and beautiful.\n",

The island was divided into several island castles – Baška, Vrbnik, Dobrinj and Omišalj,,\n  with the city of Krk as the centre. Krk princes took care of well-arranged legal relations in order to keep the peace on the island, but also,\n  cherished cultural heritage such as the Croatian language and the Glagolitic script. The Frankopan castle remained preserved almost in its original,\n  condition until today.

Archaeological research of,\n  the western part of the wall in the 1960s found drywalled megalithic blocks dating from the 3rd century b. C. Such construction preceded,\n  the Roman style of construction known as opus quadratum. Archaeological research at the square Vela Placa and the house Perossi,\n  (café Volsonis) discovered a later antique wall with many in-built spolia (stellae, Liburnian cippi, parts of architrave…). The antique,\n  walls already had towers, while the Medieval and the Renaissance ones still visible today, constitute an important part of the city’s,\n  appearance. Besides the Castle and its towers, the polygonal towers from the 15th century on the coast and the main city gates, i.e. the,\n  former tower of the Town Hall on the main city square, the city had at least seven or eight smaller towers. The walls clearly visible today,\n  emerged mostly in the 14th and the 15th century, at the time of the emergence and development of fire arms. This is also confirmed by the,\n  stylistically defined embrasures and the crenelations (merlature).,\n  The old Frankopan castle is situated on the Square Kamplin, opposite to the Krk cathedral. The castle was the central and final point of the,\n  city’s defence. It was constructed in several stages, from the 12th until the 18th century. The oldest architectural element of the castle,\n  is the rectangular Frankopan tower, so called court house. We know that it was finished in 1191 owing to the Latin inscription in the lunette,\n  above the door. Its manner of construction distinguishes it from other architectural components of the castle, while the masonry of the large,\n  dressed stone blocks remind of the nearby Romanesque church of St Quirin. This difference in the way of construction is the basis of the theory,\n  about its possible independent existence in the time before the Castle existed in Krk and its function as the cathedral bell tower.,\n  The south-western tower of the Castle, the so called Austrian, is connected by wall to the remains of the tower above the Pizanska Gates.,\n  Considering the technique of construction and individual stylistic elements, it was probably built in the 14th century.,\n  The round tower of the Castle, called the Venetian tower, is directed towards the Square Kamplin. There is a stone plaque built into its walls,\n  with the inscription Aurea Venetorum Libertati and the symbol of St Marco. The ground floor has visible conical cannon openings.

The Krk Castle is famous,\n  under the name Frankopanski, so your next stop could be a secluded castle also owned by this family called Gradec, situated in the woods near Vrbnik.,\n  An excursion towards Gradec will reveal the charming forested landscapes of the island, so it is time to go towards Baška, which is adorned by even,\n  more theatrical rocky landscapes. The history of this settlement is related to the migration of the entire population from the hills into the lowland,\n  area near the sea, depending on the historical period of peace or war. Therefore, this excursion should be ended at the church of St Ivan and the castle,\n  above Baška, where the population used to move in case of an attack from the sea. Then take a walk through the old city and the promenade along the sea.",
