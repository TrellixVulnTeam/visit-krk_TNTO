    "description": "Welcome to the historic center of Omišalj, a picturesque and layered urban structure with elements of medieval architecture, Renaissance, Baroque, historical styles of the 19th and the early 20th century. Omišalj was founded on the basis of an earlier village whose roots go back to prehistory. The original fort-type habitat defended by strong dry-walled ramparts was the seat of the Liburnian tribal community of Fertinata. It stagnated during the Roman Empire, when the nearby coastal country and port city of Fulfinum was developing, and flourished again during the early and developed Middle Ages.<br><br>Omišalj was the first among the already existing villages on the island, which in the early Middle Ages were populated en masse by immigrant Croats, achieving a harmonious coexistence with the Romanized indigenous community. During the Middle Ages, it was a stronghold of the princes of Krk, later Frankapans, who built two strong fortifications in front of it and next to it. The Venetians who ruled Omišalj in 1480 justifiably called it the 'key to the island of Krk' due to its strategic importance. Even today, this is clear to anyone who enters the historic center of city and finds himself on one of its lookouts from which one could easily see a good part of the Kvarner Bay. As nowhere else on the island of Krk, in Omišalj, parts of medieval and renaissance architecture intertwine with unusual out-of-style architectural structures. We are great as much as we hold on to the values we inherit, and as much as we preserve them for future generations. If we connect historical, artistic, archeological and historiographical data with the specifics of Omišalj tradition, speech, folk songs and customs, we will discover much about the turbulent history of this part of the island which has remained the key to the island of Krk."

      "description": "The remains of an interesting sacral edifice, the church of St Mary of the Spring is located in the camp Ježevac, on an elevated plateau,\n    surrounded by a forest. The church was first mentioned in 1486, but only the fact that it existed, not when it was built. The church is a simple,,\n    single-nave structure with semicircular apse protruding on the east side, the walls of which are made of dressed stones laid in regular layers.,\n    This way of masonry, the dimension and form of the edifice are characteristic for Romanesque churches, made from the 12th until the 13th century.,\n    Still, the findings of decorative stone reliefs indicate its slightly earlier emergence, in the 11th century. In the later stage of construction,,\n    a smaller rectangular addition was added on the northern side of the church. The thickness of the walls indicates that this was a high structure,,\n    probably a bell tower. The church is on a dominant position, offering a view of the channel, so the bell tower obviously served to alarm the,\n    population of the nearby city of Krk in case of incoming danger from the sea.,\n    A significant finding was discovered east of the church, near the apse. Here, in a live rock rising about fifty centimetres above the ground level,,\n    a deep pit was discovered, which may be interpreted as a natural well. There are visible traces of dressing on the rock, which made this inaccessible,\n    natural creation into a usable source of water through human activity. This well-spring is obviously the reason why the church was located at this,\n    site and it is the holder of the name Sancta Maria delle Aque, or St Mary of the Spring.,\n    The local tradition, noted around 1500, mentions a legend related to the church about the arrival of St Francis to the island of Krk, where he hid,\n    with his brothers from the incoming storm in the harbour along the church of the Mother of God. According to the legend, this is where they found a,\n    hermit who was taught about the rules of their order. The hermit accepted those rules and they became the basis of the establishment of the Franciscan,\n    order in the city of Krk.",

According to its stylistic characteristics it was dated into the 1st century and represents the work,\n    of several masters. The centre of the mosaic is dominated by the mythological being Triton, with a human body and a fish tail. Triton is the sea deity,,\n    the son of Poseidon and the Nereid Amphitrite. It is surrounded by images of sea fauna, dolphins and fish with stylized dragon-like features. It is,\n    assumed that Triton is just one of four figures of this mosaic floor. There is the image of the wine container – cantharus in the mosaic decoration.,\n    The container is held by another mythological being with a human torso, horse legs and a fish tail, probably an Ichthyocentaurus. Owing to the damage of,\n    the mosaic, only his mane and trident in the left hand can be recognized. The merry atmosphere and the content of the illustration indicate that this is a,\n    scene of a sea feast.,\n    The third mythological being is also preserved only in traces. This is probably Hermes’ son Pan. This is indicated by the illustration of the syrinx with,\n    which he contributed to the atmosphere of the feast.,\n    By establishing the existence of the three figures, Triton, Ichthyocentaurus and Pan, completely equal in their presentation, standing approximately at,\n    the same distance from each other, we get the impression that the fourth figure is missing, the one that would complete the image of the entire sea feast.,\n    This mosaic was probably the floor of the thermae in a luxurious private building.",

This and similar castrums,\n    served as watchtowers and military bases, while their function resulted from the wish to make the waterways safe, but also to serve as refuge for the,\n    nearby villages.

      "description": "<b>The church of All Saints in Sužan dates back to 1514 when it was built under the patronage of the brotherhood of All Saints from Sužan.</b><br><br>    Today’s parish church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, topographically situated at the highest part of the village, is a single-nave hall church,\n    laid in the direction north-south, with a large rectangular apse protruding on the northern side. On the east side of the apse there is the sacristy, and along,\n    the west wall of the apse there is the chapel of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, built in 1505. The façade on the southern side is shaped in the Classicistic,\n    style with three rectangular openings, a portal and a pair of laterally placed windows and two semi-circular niches, symmetrically placed into the outer face of,\n    the façade wall. There are two chapels situated along the eastern wall of the church hall. The one closer to the entrance is dedicated to Our Lady of Rosary and,\n    dates from the 15th century, while the second one, today walled-in, is the chapel of the Presentation of Mary, the so-called Šegina chapel from 1546. The luxurious,\n    gilded Renaissance wooden altar is situated on the main church altar. The central place is taken by the altar painting representing the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.,\n    There are no material or written sources witnessing the beginning of the establishment of the church and the parish church itself in Vrbnik. The first document,\n    about the village cathedral and the parish priest dates from 1325 from the Statute of the Brotherhood of St John the Baptist in Vrbnik. The Statute mentioned the,\n    priest Damjan and the Vrbnik parish church of St Mary. The church got its today’s appearance through late-Medieval and early Modern Era reconstructions, but there,\n    is still no physical evidence about the original church in Vrbnik.,\n    The description of the apostolic visitor Agostino Valier in 1579 is so far the most important source for the church’s appearance before the reconstructions at the,\n    end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th century, with Valier describing it as a smaller three-nave church with many altars, too small for the population.,\n    A major reconstruction followed soon after Valier’s description, which deleted all the existing elements and the church was oriented north-south. This reconstruction,\n    demolished the church of St John the Evangelist, mentioned in the canonical visitation from 1565 as a separate edifice, detached from the parish church and used as a baptistery.,\n    Recent archaeological research conducted in the smaller garden discovered the remains of an older edifice along the church façade with a semicircular wall, perhaps an,\n    apse of an older sacral edifice which preceded the today’s church.,\n    The bell tower, the indispensable motif of the Vrbnik landscape, is located to the west of the church. It was built in 1527, which is witnessed by the Glagolitic,\n    inscription at its entrance. It had four bells – three large ones and one smaller one.",

Despite systematic research in recent years, the city of Municipium Flavium Fulfinum is for the most part still unexplored and unexcavated.
